### Chapter 1

Strat notes:
- For most fight, the strat is: get Mosh Pit out asap
  - This means keep your mana crystal for T2 Mosh Pit
  - Mulligan starting hand if you don't have a starting Mosh Pit
  - If you have more than enough mana, play minions in the defended
    columns to improve the chances of Mosh Pit's Groupies spawning on
    undefended territory.
  - If Devilcore Dance + Mosh Pit: worth playing Devilcore Dance
    first.
- At first ignore defence: the hp difference means that rushing is
  best
- For offence: stack card on same column: it's slighly harder to
  defend against
