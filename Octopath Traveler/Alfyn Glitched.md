# Octopath Traveler: Alfyn Single Story (Glitched)

_These notes are adapted from [Dalia's
route](https://pastebin.com/DfVAdj3K). I've added the caitless
strategy and some extra cues._

## Evasive manoeuvre

### With Cait grind (faster but highly luck-dependent)

- New Game: Alfyn
- Save
- Void State: warp to Rippletide
- Tag Atlasdam
- Recruit Cyrus
- Scrutinize (Girl in the square): Light Soulstone (M)
- Void State: Rippletide
- Tag Stonegard
  - Kill: Cait with Light Soulstone (M)
- Skill:
  - Cyrus: Firestorm and Blizzard
- Support Skill:
  - Cyrus: EM

### No Cait grind (easy Russell)

A bit slower than the advanced method but the Russell fight is
scripted.

- New Game: Alfyn
- Save
- Void State: warp to Atlasdam
  - Optional: before opening the menu with Cyrus, you can walk
    straight down while Cyrus is intangible. Cyrus will pass through
    the ledge. And you will warp just by the chest.
- Get Thunder Soulstone (S) in the chest in the Palace (corridor to
  the right, bottom of the stairs)
- Recruit Cyrus
- Scrutinize Guard: Light Soulstone (S)
- Kill encounters on the way to Russell
- Light Soulstone (S) in the chest before Russell
- Russell
  - **Turn 1**
     - Cyrus: Fireball
     - Alfyn: Thunder Soulstone (S)
  - **Turn 2**
     - Cyrus: Staff
     - Alfyn: Light Soulstone (S)
  - **Turn 3**
     - Cyrus: Staff x2
     - Alfyn: Defend
  - **Turn 4**
     - Cyrus: Light Soulstone (S)
     - Alfyn: Icicle
  - **Turn 5**
     - Cyrus: Fireball x4
     - Alfyn: Icicle x4
- Scrutinize (Girl in the square): Light Soulstone (M)
- Whistlewood
- Menu
  - Skill:
    - Cyrus: Firestorm and Blizzard
  - Support Skill:
    - Cyrus: Evasive Manoeuvre
- TP Atlasdam
- Tag Rippletide
- Tag Stonegard

### No Cait grind (advanced Russell)

Russell can be one turn shorter. But there is RNG involved and the
fight can go several way. Taking a third fight in the Subterranean
Study may (TODO: check) guarantee a 4 turn Russell; it's not worth
forcing a third fight, but if you get one it's probably better to kill
it than escape. Even if you kill turn 5, it may save time over the
simpler script, but I haven't timed it.

- New Game: Alfyn
- Shop
  - Arcane Hatchet
  - Essence of Grape x2
  - Injurious Seed x11
- Save
- Void State: warp to Atlasdam
  - Optional: before opening the menu with Cyrus, you can walk
    straight down while Cyrus is intangible. Cyrus will pass through
    the ledge. And you will warp just by the chest.
- Get Thunder Soulstone (S) in the chest in the Palace (corridor to
  the right, bottom of the stairs)
- Recruit Cyrus
- Scrutinize Guard: Light Soulstone (S)
- Kill encounters on the way to Russell
- Light Soulstone (S) in the chest before Russell
- Russell
  - Concoct (Injurious Seed + Essence of grape) has a 50% chance to
    lower defence. If Russell's defence is lowered when Alfyn does Axe
    x4, then the fight ends turn 4. The slash notation reads as _Cyrus
    First T3_ / _Alfyn First T3_.
  - **Turn 1**
     - Cyrus: Fireball
     - Alfyn: Thunder Soulstone (S)
  - **Turn 2**
     - Cyrus: Light Soulstone (S)
     - Alfyn: Concoct (Injurious Seed + Essence of grape)
  - **Turn 3** The character that plays first must break
     - Cyrus: Staff x2 (break) / light soulstone (S)
     - Alfyn: Axe x4 / Concoct (Injurious Seed + Essence of grape) (break)
  - **Turn 4**
     - Cyrus: Fireball x3 / Fireball x4
     - Alfyn: light soulstone / Axe x4
  - **Turn 5** If Russell isn't dead
     - Cyrus: Fireball (max boost)
     - Alfyn: Axe (max boost)
- Scrutinize (Girl in the square): Light Soulstone (M)
- Whistlewood
