* Unlocks

- Tier 2 classes cost 750 and require two Tier 1 classes unlocked
- Tier 3 classes cost 2500 and require two Tier 2 classes unlocked

** Runnable classes
*** Tier 1
- Bruiser is probably the best class
  - Favour Crush, Armour for physical enemies, Holy, Swift for magical enemies
- Cat burglar has good damage output too. But it's not as good.
  - Favour Growth, Crush, Swift (probably)
*** Tier 2
- Barbarian has the best Damage output, annoying to control(?)
  - Run with /Swift 1/ and no other cards, usually (you really want the
    Withstand card in your hand at most time)
  - Wise is good, ♡ are good, it may be worth it having one extra card
    for those.
- Alchemist is safer
  - Likes Fire/Arcane/Growth, and possibly Blade.
  - After trying it out, I'm not convince it's that much safer (though
    I remember that going into the Pirates with the Barbarian was
    really hard. Do I remember correctly? Are the pirates Tier 2?
    Maybe I'm mixing up with something else).
*** Tier 3
- Cardomancer is the only runnable stock class
  - Wants a lot of draws (Swift/Arcane/wise)
- Swashbuckler is really good, but it's too slow to get in Any%
** Blessings
- Tier 1: run Warrior Spirit
- Take talisman of the crone as second unlock (required for /Idol of
  the crown/, /Crone's Mind/)
- With Cartomancer Rush /Shrine of the Crone/ Tier 3 (Gives /Arcane 1/)
** Loot
*** Tier 1
- Unlock /Blacksmith/ and /Leatherwork/ first. The other two when running
  a Tier 2 class.
*** Tier 2
(unlock rather late)
**** With Alchemist
1. Fine Awl (2nd choice)
**** With Barbarian
Wait until tier 3
**** With Cardomancer (Tier 3 class)
1. Fine Awl
**** With Swashbuckler (Tier 3 class)
1. Fine Chisel?
* Bosses
** Level ⭐ area
- Ice Cream area unlocked after any 1 area is cleared
- /Evil lich!/ unlocks after 3 (2?) areas are cleared
- Playing the level out of order, I seem to have managed to block
  myself out of the final dungeon (/nosy eye/). I'm not sure what the
  condition is. I believe I played /Gobliiins/, /None shall
  pass/, /Evil Lich!/, /A Victimless Crime/, /Firelord/.
*** Embro
- /Firelord/
*** Mimic Queen
- /A Victimless Crime/
- Brittle, mostly magic attacks
*** Orc Warrior
- /Gobliiins/
- Name of the area?
- Physical attacks, stupidity
- Kill 2 enemies for level 3 before Fountain of Stupidity. The Gnolls
  can be dangerous.
- Kill 1 Gnoll to shake the fountain, then kill a level 3 enemy for
  level 4
- Unlocks Black Knight/None shall pass(?, at least when beaten first)
*** Evil Lich
- /Evil Lich!/
- Frail (+1 to our physical damage)
*** Black knight
- /None shall pass/
- Mundane, mostly magic attacks
*** Eye beast
- /Nosy eye/
- Unlocks superchump
- Unlocks Level ⭐⭐ area
- ~1000 gold reward
**** Quest 1
- Basilisk are risky, take an extra encounter for level 4, probably
** Level ⭐⭐ area
- It's basically impossible to get 750 gold before entering it.
- Play the Pirate Map early, otherwise it'll keep taking up one card choice.
