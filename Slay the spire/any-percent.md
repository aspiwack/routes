Slay the spire any% (unseeded)
==============================

[Glitch reference](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/101K_6xxDjQH2caGApCMxgrybOScGw0VRwd5C-qYl0tA/edit#gid=0), 
[Glitch tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8gYeZQGH1Y) by
Forgotten Arbiter with more detailed descriptions.

First glitches to learn:
- _Screenlayer removal_ (very easy): make Pandora's Box and and Bell
  Curse have no downside.
- _Double node buffer_: on a forking path visit both pass (useful when
  they are both chests, or both campfires). You continue from the
  second clicked node.
- Ignore any glitch requiring controller inputs, they only get
  relevant when you reach top times.

Basic strategy:
- Avoid fight nodes
  - Prefer chests, campfires, or shops
  - Then ? nodes
  - Then normal fights over elites (note: one elite is better than two
    normal fights).
- Keep decks small
  - Skip adding cards when the proposed card don't support your
    strategy.
  - In a typical run you should add no more than 10 cards to your
    deck.
- Always start with “The first 3 fights have 1 HP”.
  - This gives you a bit of time at the beginning to find cards that
    will bootstrap your damage output.
  - Neow offers this option when you haven't reached level 15 in your
    previous run.
  - If Neow doesn't offer this option then Abandon Run (which counts
    as a loss at level 0) and restart the run.

Execution:
- Use the keyboard shortcut for the map (M by default, but I prefer
  remapping all the keyboard shortcuts to the left hand) to exit all
  events. Except:
  - Text events, where you typically have to click on the _Leave_
    dialogue option to activate the next node.
  - Area bosses: opening the map only shows the same area. You have to
    click the _Proceed_ button to load the new map.
- Use keyboard shortcuts to choose cards (default 1-10, I remapped to
  asdfgbvcxz to have everything on the left hand, and the the most
  common keys on the home row)
  - This way the mouse stays near the enemies to select them quickly.
  - There is an option in the _Game settings_ to display the shortcut
    above each card.
- Use the keyboard shortcut (E by default) to end turn

### Further resources

- Favourable game states [have been collated][file_setups] for every
  category. In particular they force some of the bosses for faster
  completion. Will improve your times, but resetting becomes slower.
- A [general guide][oohbleh_guide], by OohBleh, to speedrunning Slay
  the Spire. It contains some general explanation, as well as some
  advanced techniques, and links to relevant resources.

## The Ironclad

[Guide for Ironclad any%][ironclad_sub6] with most safeties
removed, when aiming for top times, by Forgotten Arbiter. It's worth
reading through anyway, as it gives more context.

[ironclad_sub6]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DXQgwbz-KAJf0FCEoGq4yjE63JdaMfOMk5l_sklF8Cs/edit#heading=h.qr0ic38pjppd

We want a deck with strength upgrades and multi-attacks so that
strength upgrades count several times. We also want card draws and
energy.


### Card removal
- Remove Defend-s in priority

### Deckbuilding
- The best attack is Whirlwind (5 damage on _all enemies_ X
  times). Take over anything else.
  - 1 is all you need. But it may make sense to add a second one if
    your deck is a bit big.
  - A good alternative is Sword Boomerang (3 damage 3 times on random
    enemies, costs 1). But you will need more than one. Or a Heavy
    Blade.
  - Heavy Blade (14 damage, costs 2, strength affects it 3 times) is
    not strictly a multi-attack. But strength affects it multiple
    time. It's quite good against bosses, but you will want to
    complete it with a Sword Boomerang for regular fight to be able to
    hit multiple enemies in a single attack.
  - If all else fails, Twin Strike (5 damage twice, costs 1) or Pummel
    (2 damages 4 times, costs 1, exhaust) can get you started.
- Clash (14 damage, costs 0, can only be used if all the cards in hand
  are attacks, which makes removing) is a good damage complement as
  it can be played after a Whirlwind.
- Double Tap (this turn, your next attack is played twice, costs 1)
  - Take 1 copy.
- The best strength item is Flex (+2 strength now, -2 strength at the
  end of the turn, costs 0). Take over anything else but Whirlwind (or
  energy cards if you already have Whirlwind and are still on 3
  energy).
  - You ideally want 2 Flex. 3 may be good too.
  - Once you have strength upgrades, Limit Break (Double your
    strength, costs 1, exhaust) is helpful. You can take 1 or 2.
  - Alternatives are Flaming Sword (+2 strength, costs 1) or Spot
    Weakness (target an enemy who intends to attack, +3 strength,
    costs 1).
- Offering (-6 HP +2 energy, draw 3, exhaust, costs 0), being both a
  good draw card and an energy boost, is tremendously useful. Take
  over anything except your first Whirlwind and your first Flex.
  - Having 3 Offerings is great.
  - Battle Trance (draw 3, costs 0, you can't draw additional cards
    this turn) is a great source of draws as well. There is almost
    never a reason not to take 1.
  - If energy is short, one Bloodletting (-3 HP, +2 energy, costs 0)
    can be helpful. Take one if you have Whirlwind.
  - Seeing Red (+2 energy, costs 2) can be a backup.
- Thunderclap (4 damage and 1 vulnerable to all enemies, costs 1),
  because it affects all enemies, and only costs one, is often a
  better way than Bash (from the starting deck) to reinforce your
  early deck.
  - Take 1 if you don't have Bag of Marbles (relic: apply 1 vulnerable
    to all enemies on the first turn of the fight) the deck isn't
    quite working yet.

### Upgrading

_slightly adapted from Forgotten Arbiter's guide_

Upgrade, in order of priority:

1. Whirlwind
1. Flex
1. Bash (if Act 1 and no Bag of Marbles)
1. Offering
1. Double Tap/Sword Boomerang/Heavy Blade
1. Everything else except Defend and Strike
1. Strike (if Act 1)

### Shops

The general priorities (in no particular order, it depends on the
deck) are

- Juzu Bracelet (take over anything else)
- Buy Chemical X (cost X card act as if you spent 2 extra
  energy). Take over anything else if you have Whirlwind.
- Buy the cards you need (especially Whirlwind and Flex)
- Remove Defend-s (then Strike-s, then any card that has now become
  superfluous)
- Buy strength-upgrading relics.

Forgotten Arbiter's guide also lists these important relics (in order
of priority)

1. Akabeko
1. Brimstone
1. Bottled Flame (Only if targeting Whirlwind)
1. Bag of Marbles
1. Lantern

### Boss Relics

1. Take Pandora's Box (with glitch) above all else
2. Take any energy upgrade
3. Astrolabe, Calling Bell (with glitch)
4. Anything that doesn't prevent your deck from working.


## The Watcher

### Quick (no ascension) watcher guide from Z.

[_Originally shared on Discord_](https://discord.com/channels/429108723797983241/933108854705778808/937061691391348797)

Cards to pick
- Crescendo (easy 0 cost free double damage) (remove eruption after
  picking up this one(remove vigilance first))
- Bowling bash, really cheap alternative for damage, will be very
  helpful in act 2
- Consecrate (free aoe)
- Crush joints (A tier card, free vuln. Use with miracle)
- Carve reality (A tier damage)
- Conclude (A tier, will carry you pretty much till act 3)
- Signature move. (Only if you know what you are doing tier, good with
  consecrates)

Combo pieces
- Wreath of flames (Works great with rag and conclude what more to
  say)
- Ragnarok (The main card you are really looking for)
- Blasphemy ( A better Crescendo, who wants double damage when you can
  triple) ( Blasph + wreath + rag should end most fights) ( Carefull
  in act 3 tho )
- Scrawl (For when you haven't removed enough cards, also free draw,
  can't be bad)
- Trip (always buy if you can afford) All other cards are a no go.

Potions Most potions are good. Except for the defensive ones, toss em
out to make space for the good ones.  Power potions are trash, don't
bother. If you did bother, the only good one is battle hymn, maybe
fasting too but that a desperado move.

Notable potions
- Liquid memories
- Smoke bomb
- Strenght and flex pots
- Fear potions
- Duplication potion


Relics
- Pandora's
- Energy relics
- Akabeko
- Bag of marbles

Strategy

Upgrade Eruption first, always (unless you picked up a crescendo then
upgrade the crescendo first) Remove vigilance first always Don't worry
about not picking up a lot of cards in act 1, watcher works wonders
with strikes and vuln should do wonders.

Learn the important glitches, (Pbox. Curse skipping, double noding,
double bossing, Yass queening, Cory) Don't be shy to double boss to
imporve your odds of Pbox + Rag.

Watch the top leaderboard runs to understand the general strats and
pathing choices.

Take the path with the least resistance aka, the less combats the
better.  Prioritize card removals. We are trying to get exodia here,
the less cards you have the better.

While shopping try to remove the defends early, but don't spend all
your $$. Try to save to buy the important relics / cards. There is a
fine balancing act of money management that I won't get into depth
here. But Important relics > Removals (Since we are hoping for a Pbox
highroll anyway) I'll probably write a fuller/more in-depth guide for
all the characters soon
